# Research-Abstract

The research I am pursuing in this assignment is hormones in foods.  I have decided to continue this topic to continue informing and researching so others may be more aware.  Each of these sources contains information that will allow me to advocate for agriculture and the hormones used.  Hormones are not to be feared be there are no artifical hormone added to any food product consumed by humans.  All hormones are naturally produced by the aniamls which are the same hormones given to the animals to increase production.  This makes the process completely safe for both the animals producing the food and humans consuming the food.  These sources contain the information for beef and dairy, two of the largest consumed products.
